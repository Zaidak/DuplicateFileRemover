DuplicateFileRemover
====================

A small app to recursively hash all files and remove any duplicates from a specified directory.  Known to work on Windows 7 with NTFS, should be cross platform compatible and cross file system compatible.

Update
======
After forking from Inumedia/DuplicateFileRemover, the utility was edited to move files to a C:\duplicate_moved directory.
The code requires cleanup and renaming from Remover - Mover.
